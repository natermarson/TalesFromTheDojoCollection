NOTE: TALES FROM THE DOJO IS TO NEVER BE SOLD AND WILL STAY FREE, 
IF YOU PAID MONEY FOR THIS YOU HAVE BEEN SCAMMED!!!

	Tales From the Dojo is a free use album
made specifically for the Hyun's Dojo Community!
Most of the songs are made specifically for a 
character or theme but they are intended to be used
however you see fit! Slap em wherever! 

	This album also includes many assets that were 
used in the making of the songs/artwork so that you can
mess with them to your hearts content! 

	This is intended to be a yearly thing but it's
always possible that this will be the only one i make!
only time will tell. 

	Anyways, enjoy!
